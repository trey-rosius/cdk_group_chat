# Modern Serverless Application Development with AWS Amplify,Flutter, GraphQL,CDK and Typescript

## Case Study : Building a Group Chat Application.

Serverless computing is the most recent and recommended approach to building modern cloud applications.
Serverless enables developers to focuse on the business logic and how their application brings value to end users, rather than on configuration and operations of the servers running their applications.

By not focusing on operations or infrastructure provisioning, the time it takes for an application to move from prototype to production is cut in half. Iteration is rapid, user feedback is quick, leading to significant app improvements.
Let's take a look at a step by step guide on how to build a fullstack serverless mobile group chat application.
Here's a list of frameworks and languages we would be using in-order to accomplish this task.

- [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)
- [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/)
- [Cloud Development Kit(CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/flutter/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

## AWS AppSync

AWS AppSync allows developers to easily implement engaging real-time application experiences by automatically publishing data updates to subscribed API clients via serverless WebSockets connections.
With AWS AppSync, you can build APIs that support real-time data via WebSockets, so that your applications always have the most up-to-date information. AppSync also integrates well with core application features, such as authentication and authorization, so that you can focus on building the core functionality of your application.

Developers using AppSync can leverage

- AppSync real-time capabilities.
- Offline data synchronization.
- Built-in server-side caching.
- Fine-grained access control.
- Security.
- Support for business logic in the API layer using GraphQL resolvers, and more.

## GraphQl

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, giving clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.

## Cloud Development Kit(CDK)

CDK is an infrastructure as Code framework that helps you rapidly define your cloud resources using modern languages such as TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#/. Net, and Go.

## AWS Amplify

## Flutter

Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

Flutter transforms the app development process. Build, test, and deploy beautiful mobile, web, desktop, and embedded apps from a single codebase
