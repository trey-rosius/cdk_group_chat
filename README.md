# A GraphQl Group Chat Api built with CDK, TypeScript,Appsync and Single Table Design

I'll approach this project in a branch based manner.

## Branches

- schema
-

## Access Patterns

### Users

- Create User Account

```
PK: USER#USERID
SK: USER#USERID
```

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
